      <p>"You don't understand it if you can't teach it to another student".</p>
      <p>What started as a way for me to remember valuable lessons I learned during my time struggling in Calculus, soon became an educational figure in my school. Yummy Math is a tutor, teacher, and entertainer who is enthusastic about helping students overcome the same struggles he went through in AP Calculus at Encinal High. Below is a progression of this character over the past couple of years. </p>

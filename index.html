      <p id="about-text">I am a first generation Asian American student that comes from a low income family background. Growing up, I rarely saw my parents and because of that, I've always felt a sense of independence. While I am thankful for their hard work in keeping our family stable, it was through my own initiative that lands me where I am today and created the character than I am. Being deeply dedicated to my studies, I constantly look for ways to improve and build my portfolio. My interests lies in web development and teaching math. My goal of transferring to UC Berkeley combines these two majors into Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The biggest motivator in my life is my family because knowing where I came from makes me proud of my achomplishments and strive to do better! </p>

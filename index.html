      <h4 id="about-title">About Me</h4>
      <img src="aboutimage.jpg">
      <p>I am a first generation Asian American student that comes from a low income family background. Growing up, I rarely saw my parents and because of that, I've always felt a sense of independence. While I am thankful for their hard work in keeping our family stable, it was through my own initiative that lands me where I am today and created the character than I am. Being deeply dedicated to my studies, I constantly look for ways to improve and build my portfolio. My interests lies in web development and teaching math. My goal of transferring to UC Berkeley combines these two majors into Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The biggest motivator in my life is my family because knowing where I came from makes me proud of my achomplishments and strive to do better! </p>

      <h2>What is Yummy Math?</h2>
      <p>One of the most valuable things my teacher has told me was, "you don't understand it if you can't teach it to another student". What first started as a way for me to remember valuable lessons I learnt, during my time struggling in Calculus, soon became my online alias as an educational figure in my school. Yummy Math is a tutor, teacher, and entertainer who is enthusastic about helping students overcome the same struggles he went through in AP Calculus at Encinal High. Below is a progression of this character over the past couple of years. </p>
